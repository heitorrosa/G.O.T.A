# G.O.T.A

A continuation of my Elementary School's Final Paper for creating a Hydric Drone using the Arduino ecosystem called G.O.T.A (Gotejador Orientado por Técnologia Aérea), now with the help of a ground station using the LoRa environment
and in-depth guides and changes that will be applied to this project, dont expect many commits, its just my personal project and will have its pace determined on how engaged I am with paying lots of money for hardware from AliExpress, lol.
 I mostly created this repo because I didin't want to lose the code like the other version, and I wanted to share the experience I gained building this drone from scratch, things that I went through and help other people trying to adventure through these areas.

 ### Missing Features and Ideas
 - Implementing the LoRa system in pair with the RemoteXY framework to be used as a remote
 - Implementing a GPS System
 - Full FPV coverage at the same range as the LoRa RC
 - Getting a higher capacity battery (I was using an 2S 30C, which, doesnt provide enough amps to power the motors at high speeds with the MPU6050 module)
 - Getting an autolanding system to work if the drone is disconnected from its Ground Station
 - Make a new frame from the scratch for the drone, using 3D modeling and a chassis for the Ground Station

Please, fell free to open an Issue if you have any questions or want to help me improve this project, it would really help me and i'm sure that it will help others too.
